      abstract: |-
        The aim of CCREST-M is to improve the representation of cirrus and ice
        cloud within weather and climate models using the FAAM BAe-146 aircraft
        as the central platform. CCREST-M aims to capture simultaneous passive
        (FAAM aircraft) and active (Chilbolton radars) remote sensing 
        measurements across the microwave and sub-millimetre spectrum to better
        constrain ice scattering models, and to improve upon them to improve 
        weather and climate model predictions.
